# WindowsLoggerLite

Windows Logger Lite is a privacy-conscious monitoring tool designed specifically for Windows systems. It runs silently as a background service and is intended for system administrators, technical support teams, and power users who need localized, high-precision logs of hardware status and application usage for system analysis, troubleshooting, and performance review.

üîßKey Features

- Silent Background Monitoring:Runs silently in the background with elevated privileges and no user interface, ensuring zero disruption to computer users.
- Comprehensive Logging:Periodically logs dynamic hardware data, tracks application start/stop events in real time, and includes commonly used static system information in reports.
- Secure Local Persistence:All data is stored locally in password-protected, encrypted Excel files. A caching mechanism ensures that logs are not lost even in the event of a sudden shutdown.
- Zero-Configuration Self-Deployment:On first run, the program automatically sets itself up by creating a scheduled task for auto-start on boot.
- Intelligent Environment Awareness:Detects removable drives and dynamically loads dependencies (e.g., LibreHardwareMonitor) as needed, providing a more intelligent and adaptive experience.
- Multi-language Support:Automatically detects the system language and localizes all output content, including reports and message prompts.

‚ö†Ô∏èImportant Notes

To simplify deployment for administrators, the software is designed to automatically create a scheduled task on its first run to enable auto-start on boot.
This behavior might be flagged as suspicious by antivirus software on some Windows versions, which could result in the task creation failing or the executable being quarantined.
> üí°Recommendation:
Before running the software, add WindowsLoggerLite.exe to the exclusion list in Windows Defender or any other security software you're using.

This project is fully open-source, and its security is guaranteed by the contributions and reviews of developers across the community. Feel free to use it with confidence!

üöÄ Usage

After launching Windows Logger Lite, you also need to start LibreHardwareMonitor and configure it with the following "Options" settings:
- Enable Start minimized
- Enable Minimize To Tray
- Enable Minimize On Close
- Enable Run On Windows Startup
These options ensure seamless background monitoring and integration with Windows Logger Lite.

üìÅ Log File Storage

Daily log files are stored in D:\SystemLog\ by default. If drive D: is not available, logs will be saved in C:\SystemLog\.
All logs are automatically encrypted each day.The default password is: WindowsLogger

Recommended tools for viewing the logs:
- ONLYOFFICE (Free & open-source office suite)
- Microsoft Excel

üí° Why This Project Exists

There are many tools out there with similar functionality, but most of them have critical drawbacks. For example:

- Not truly invisible:
This tool was originally designed to run on public computers performing specific tasks ‚Äî such as smart information kiosks in exhibition halls ‚Äî where usage needs to be monitored without interfering with regular operation. The goal was to make the tool completely silent and unnoticeable to the end user.

- Poor multilingual support:
In my opinion, proper language support is a basic requirement that lowers the barrier to entry for all users. Many existing tools fail in this area.

- Data that's too detailed or noisy:
I wanted to help technical support staff resolve issues quickly, so I intentionally excluded some of the less relevant or overly technical data points based on my own experience.

- Missing key features:
For instance, encrypted log files aren‚Äôt meant to protect highly sensitive information ‚Äî the goal is simply to prevent accidental modification or corruption, especially on public or shared machines.

Because of these gaps, I decided to build a tool that fits these specific needs myself.
